Adding JWT and Session Callbacks to Your NextAuth Configuration
To add the role-based JWT and session callbacks to your existing NextAuth configuration, you need to integrate them with your current setup. Here's how to do it:

Key Points:
Added the JWT callback: This stores the user's role in the JWT token when a user signs in

Added the Session callback: This makes the role available in the session object that you can access using useSession() in your components

Preserved your existing redirect callback: The redirect logic you already had is maintained

Integrated with your existing providers: Works with both Credentials and Google providers


# Sign in with a user that has a role in your database
# Use this component to check if the role is properly included in the session:

"use client";

import { useSession } from "next-auth/react";

export default function RoleChecker() {
  const { data: session } = useSession();
  
  return (
    <div className="p-4 bg-white rounded shadow">
      <h2 className="text-xl font-bold">Session Data</h2>
      <pre className="mt-2 bg-gray-100 p-2 rounded">
        {JSON.stringify(session, null, 2)}
      </pre>
    </div>
  );
}
